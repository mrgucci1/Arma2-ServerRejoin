# Arma2-ServerRejoin

Python BOT that uses image recognition from pyautogui. It waits for buttons to appear on screen, and when they do it gets its pixel location and then clicks them. If any of the buttons appear on screen, then that means we need to click them! Checks the screen every two minutes. 

Designed to be used with the DayZ Mod for Arma2. Running this on a system will allow a charatcer to rejoin the server after a server restart (each restart occurs every 4 hours) and respawn after character death.
